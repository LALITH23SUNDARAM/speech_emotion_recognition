## Speech Emotion Recognition

**Abstract:** 

Emotion recognition is one of Natural Language processing technique its primary objective is 
to take-up Man-Machine Interaction to another Level. Many industries try to incorporate this 
technique in their system for better user engagement. In 2018, leading audio streaming 
platform Spotify patented their recommendation engine to suggests songs based on user’s 
emotional state. In this project by considering above motive as upfront, I developed an web application 
to tagging the emotion over audio input from the user’s.
